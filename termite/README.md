# termite terminal emulator configuration.
place the "config" file under **~/.config/termite/** folder

termite contains almost all needed features out of the box

## note on ranger colorscheme
Ranger's default colorscheme reads from the terminal colorschemes
the *copied/cut/selected* file color (that black issue) can be solved by
adjusting **color8** in the color pallete. This is already done for termite
configuration but needs to be adapted for other terminals
