# arch_linux_configuration
This repository contains my personal ArchLinux configuration files and customization ideas

Each directory will have its own configuration files along with a README.md file individually

* the file "bash_profile" is added to the home directory under hidden state ("."-prefix) so as to enable auto startx to work

* the bashrc file is also similar to bash_profile and can be added after checking the needed.

## applications to install for fresh installation
* firefox
* pcmanfm
* rxvt-unicode
* bash-completion "for autocomplete" if using bash.
* fonts from https://github.com/powerline/fonts
* zsh shell and oh-my-zsh https://ohmyz.sh/
* ttf-font-awesome font package for font symbols: i3blocks to work properly.

## Things to be configured
* pcmanfm for colorschemes
