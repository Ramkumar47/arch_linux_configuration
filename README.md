# arch_linux_configuration
This repository contains my personal ArchLinux configuration files and customization ideas

Each directory will have its own configuration files along with a README.md file individually

* the file "bash_profile" is added to the home directory under hidden state ("."-prefix) so as to enable auto startx to work

* the bashrc file is also similar to bash_profile and can be added after checking the needed.

## applications to install for fresh installation
* firefox
* pcmanfm
* rxvt-unicode
* bash-completion "for autocomplete"

## Things to be configured
* pcmanfm for colorschemes
