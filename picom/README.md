# picom configuration #
This is the configuration file for compton i.e. picom

place this file under **$HOME/.config/** folder

NOTE: this configuration is tested to use but requires little more power in the machine so, it is not used in the desktop.

install **picom** from the repository and configure it in such that it starts with i3 as well, just like **dunst**
