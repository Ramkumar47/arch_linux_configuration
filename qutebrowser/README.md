# qutebrowser configuration
place the file **config.py** in the *~/.config/qutebrowser/* folder
for the configuration to be read by the browser

by default, the colorschemes of dracula was applied and writen into this
config.py file. this file was generated from the browser itself using the
command **config-write-py**

Note:
inside the *~/.config/qutebrowser/* directory, there will be other files and folders
regarding history, bookmarks and quickmarks.. during this file generation, there
was insignificant stuff in those files for including them in the repository.
Hence they might be added in the future update to the repository.
