this folder contains the fonts files taken from manjaro i3
they can be successfully implemented in Arch i3 configuration

copy the contents of the manjaro_fonts.tar.gz onto
/usr/share/fonts/ directory

the file list_of_installed_fonts.txt is just for reference of locations

there will be some fonts in the Arch directory, that were installed either
by system or by manual and these are just additional fonts.
